        <h1>All About Boston's Beaches</h1>
        <p>No visit to Massachusetts is complete without going to the beach. The beaches across the state of Massachusetts are beautiful. Here are some reccomendations from a local!</p>

        <h2>Cape Cod Beaches</h2>
        <p>Cape Cod is a famous Massachusetts destination. In the summer, people from all around the world flock to this area for its beaches and summer lifestyle.</p>

            <h3>Beachcomber of Wellfleet</h3>
            <p>If you only go to one beach in Massachusetts, make it the Beachcomber. At almost the tip of Cape Cod, the Beachcomber is a beautiful beach in Wellfleet, the Beachcomber is famous for its restaurant and live music hosted in the summer. But fair warning, during the peak season the lot closes early. You'll have to set your alarm to make it!</p>
            <h3>Old Silver Beach - Falmouth</h3>
            <p>I have been coming to Old Silver since before I can remember. It is a quiet beach at the Eastern end of Cape Cod, so it is a shorter drive from Boston than the Beachcomber. This beach is also perfect for viewing the sunset during the summer./p>

        <h2>North Shore Beaches</h2>
        <p>As the name implies, the North Shore is a coastal area to the north of Boston. This is often a quicker, less tourist-y trip than going to Cape Cod. Some of my earliest memories belong to the beaches of the North Shore, so it has a special place in my heart.</p>

            <h3>Wingaersheek Beach</h3>
            <p>Wingaersheek is a small, semi-unknown beach in Gloucester, Masachusetts. The beach is around 45 minutes from Boston, but it is well worth the drive. The best part of Wingaersheek in my opinion is all the rocks around the beach, which are perfect for climbing and exploring.</p>
            <h3>Good Harbor Beach</h3>
            <p>Good Harbor Beach is another beach located in Gloucester. This beach is bigger, making it a popular option for beach-goers in the peak season.</p>
